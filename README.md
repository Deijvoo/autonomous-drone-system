# Autonomous Drone System (in progress)

This project is an indoor autonomous drone platform built on ESP32 microcontrollers with custom C++ firmware.  
It uses wireless ESP-NOW communication for real-time control, nested PID loops for position/velocity regulation, and SBUS output to a Betaflight-compatible flight controller.

---

## ðŸ§  Architecture

The system consists of:
- **ESP32 Sender** connected to a computer via USB, receiving control signals from a Python backend and relaying them to the drone over ESP-NOW
- **ESP32 Receiver** on the drone, parsing incoming commands and feeding them to a nested PID control system
- **SBUS signal generation** to communicate with the flight controller
- **FPV video** is streamed separately to the computer via analog signal and processed by OpenCV

## âœ… Features

- âœ… ESP-NOW wireless communication
- âœ… C++ firmware with nested PID loops (position + velocity)
- âœ… SBUS signal generation
- âœ… Ground effect compensation logic
- ðŸŸ£ Python-based trajectory optimizer + vision tracking *(coming soon)*

> The drone is controlled based on real-time analysis of FPV video received by the computer.  
> The backend processes the video and calculates control commands sent to the drone via ESP-NOW.
